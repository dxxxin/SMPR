###SMPR:
SMPR:a structure-based multimodal prediction model for drug-disease repositioning

###Introduction :
SMPR is a drug disease repositioning model.
The model has made improvements to address the following issues:
1.Enhance the importance of drug structure.
2.Drug cold start. Effective prediction can also be made for drugs that are not in the datasetã€‚
3.Facing pharmacological workers. Provide executable software for convenient use.

SMPR provides two datasets, Dataset A and Dataset C. The cold start training dataset is modified based on Dataset A.
Dataset A contains 894 drugs and 454 diseases.
Dataset C contains 579 drugs and 274 diseases.
###The Dataset A:

###requirements :
    ptython=3.10
    torch=2.4.1+cuda121
    DGL >= 0.5.2

###Use the model:
    For model training, please run Python main.py directly.
    The training main parameters that can be called include: 
    1. --dataset, defult Kdataset, Fdataset (Dataset F), Kdataset (Dataset A),cold_start
    2. --nfold, defult 5
    3. --learning_rate, default 0.005
    4. --hidden_feats, default 64

    For the cold start:
    For a cold start, recommand Leonurine.py. You can add a prior knowledge for new drug, the relationship between drug and diseases of Kdataset, can recommand dataset/Leonurine/Prior_knowledge.csv

###Files :
    An executable program can be downloaded and used directly on a Windows system.
    The exe file is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-9kS8z5skg0C1SyKYjGWP_37AtIQgnc/view?usp=drive_link
